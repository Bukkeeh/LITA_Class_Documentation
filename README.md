### This where I documented my first project while learning Data Analysis with the Incubator Hub

### Basics of Data Analysis 
---
- Foundations of Data
- Introduction to Ms Excel
- Basic Excel Functions
- Reports & Dashboard in Excel
- Project/Challenge

### Data Literacy 
---
It is how we should percieve data and some of the difference that our data can be on for us to do certain things
or before we are able to make meanings out of that data set.
- Data Generation
- Data Structure
- Data Storage
- statistics   
- Data Driven Decision Making
  
### Data System
---
The Two (2) Systems Every Organizations Run:
- Operational System:They are the systems the organization uses to execute their business processes
  i.e. SAP, Oracle and Zoom is an operational system. 
- Analytic System: They are the systems the organization uses to evaluate business processes.
 i.e. Self service BI tools like Power BI

### Rolls and Columns we have in Excel

- Rolls   - 1,048,578
- Columns - 16,384
  
### Tools Used for Cleaning Data
---
- Open Refine
- Melissa
- IBM
- SAS
- Power Query
- Win Pure
- Tri Facta

### Data Analysis: is getting insights from data. i.e. turning raw data into actionable insights
---    
- **Ingestion** is the process to get data from the web to Power BI
- **Transformation** is the process of changing a particular column i.e. changing from a whole no to decimal point.
- **Modelling** is the prcess of having a number of tables to connect.
- **Visualization** is the process of building out chart.
- **Analysis** is the process of employing or deploying some statitical measures or techniques.
 
### Why do we Run Data Analysis:
---
- To know what is working.
- What is not working.
- What we should focus on.

### Microsoft Excel Functions 
---


### Data Visualization

### Data Cleaning and Preparations

### Exploratory Data Analysis 

### Data Analysis
This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries.
