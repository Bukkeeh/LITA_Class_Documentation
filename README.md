### PROJECT TITLE - MS EXCEL FUNCTIONS AND SEQUEL QUERY LANGUAGE (SQL)

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
---
This data analysis aim is to explain how we should perceive data and some of the difference that our data can be on for us to do certain things or before we are able to make meanings out of the data set, however the overall aim of this is to have a detailed understanding of Data Analysis which comprises of Data Literacy, Operational Systems, Analytic System, Data Storage Data Entry, Data Cleaning, Structuring of Data, Analysing Data and Data Visulaization.

### DATA SOURCES 
---
The primary source of data is LITA Incubator Hub and Data Sale.CSV, this is an open source that can be frely downloaded from an open source online such as Kaggle or Fred or any other repository site.

### TOOL USED
---
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsft.com) 
    1. For Data Cleaning
    2. For Analysis
    3. For Data Visualization
- SQL - Structured Query Lanaguage for Querying of Data
- GitHub for Portflio Building
- Power BI - for Data Manipulation and Visualisation

### Microsoft Excel Functions 
---
The following functions was carried out in MS Excel:
- Formulars and fucntions such as 

### STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE - (SQL)
---
SQL is used for storing and managing data data in Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). However, it allows users to query the database in a number of ways, using English-like statements.

### SQL Command includes:

- DDL - Data Definition Language
- DML - Data Manipulation Language
- DCL - Data Control Language
- TCL - Transaction Control Language
- DQL - Data Query Language
